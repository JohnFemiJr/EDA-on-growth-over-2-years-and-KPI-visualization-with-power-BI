This is a project on report of Sales performance for a Brokage firm valued at Billions on Sales performance and Net increase persentation comparing 2021 and 2022.
This project was based on information from the sales permance individually to see who was growing and who has not grown based on the Target and Time in service. The project also talks about the company growth in deposit and net but it was intresting to find out that despite the growth in deposit and Netto there's was still decrease in average percentage based on the higher Targets.
